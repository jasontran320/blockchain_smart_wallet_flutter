Note: I used vscode to build a flutter app template from which I modifed/created these files. I chose not to include the templated flutter app stuff for the sake of clarity. Smart wallet with block chain integration using ganash, truffle + solidity to make the smart contracts, web3 to connect the flutter app to the block chain, and gemini ai api for the financial analysis.
